## Detailed Log
### Casual Breakfast shenanigans
- [[Seeker]] reports too early
	- found out about new mission option:
	- New portal
- [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] checks maps for water world planet info
- [[Torvold]] finds out the mirrors are fake & that the [[Knarl_npc|Knarl]]'s caramel makes strangers big
- [[Chance]] challenges the chef to weekly all you can eat & then gets sad that the halfling giant didn't "grow up" like Chance & it was more like knarl's candy. Got a bag of food for bollywogs to trade for shinies.
- [[Pyrin]] has a mysterioiusly new bracelet. It's resisting identification

[[Keppuc_Un_npc|Keppuc]] & [[Knarl_npc|Knarl]] give us the debriefing & next missions
New missions:
New portals opened:
- 2 scouts sent, 1 returned, but in psych ward now. Brought back item/weapon skull-maul. It's alive & chatty & vindictively taunting everyone?!

[[bollywog mission]]: [[Dr_ Doolots_npc]] dragonborn. whole planet is a swamp. Twollybog villages around the planet, this one is particularly fervent religious. Bollywogs are kinda secretive & welcomed her, but aren't telling her much. Several field assistants went missing, & they told her about the swamp curse. She didn't believe in the deities, but now it's another matter. Rescue the assistants & uncover the mysteries. Broodling spawns are cool looking. 
Gathered magic items. always have basic med kit/torches/rations
