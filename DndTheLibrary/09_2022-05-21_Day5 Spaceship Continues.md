## Session Summary


## Detailed Log
Retcon: [[Pyrin]] has been protecting the shuttle while we adventured. We begin the session having returned to shuttle & updating him about what we've found while we take a short rest

[[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] makes a confession: [[Vortirrackt_monster_darkmatter|vortirrackt]] aren't as stupid as everyone thinks, and bc they're actually telepathic, they probably al know that we're here. The big one was probably a breeding colony here. They're also worried about us dying, brutally. 

First we found ashower room, then a nest room with 8 egg sacks
We made it to the front helm/bridge, these 3 bodies aren't carnage like the first, but more like they crashed into something (like the ship stopped fast). all strapped in the their chairs (which usually keep follks safe...). No external damage. (we've now found 4 of the 5 bodies total)
Extremely rare that a ship would exit warp early. There's stories of big scratch marks or time dilation happening after jumps. Warps do use/traverse the void where [[Vortirrackt_monster_darkmatter|vortirrackt]] live...
Aside from odd scattering & dust, nothing seems broken.
??What what the room before it became a nest? (what environment did they pick as a nest room is what I'm after)

[[Seeker]] downloads the logs & tries to find out stuff: the jump didn't go as planned. WHen theship emerged, there was a time jump that also happened of 3 days & that's probably what caused the shock killing these 3. Nowadays we use pods to survive those shocks. Absolute wrong end of the galaxy. It's still just in the same open space it first came out, plus a little drift. Comm logs: someone tried to send a mayday several days later (about 30 min after ship exited warp). Something is preventing comms from getting off ship, unknown what. Personal logs: nothing odd before jump. post logs from the 2 survivors: engineer survived bc of a pod, nobody's responding, found the bridge with the bodies, gonna try a mayday. Latter another log about message not sending & he'd figured out that the external antenna thingy is ripped off & just gone & realized the time jump & both engines/nav systems broken. (Can the [[Vortirrackt_monster_darkmatter|vortirrackt]] do all this durring the jump???) Only those 2 from engineer. Lead researcher left a couple logs too, all this is out of her domain, but very frantic logs, then a sudden stop 3 hours after they woke up. 

take all the sentimentals/personal effects from the bodies. [[Torvold]] raises a couple to replace his melted skellies. we find a map of the whole ship
on to the emergency room, where we can heal up [[chance]] picks up scalpels & laser scalpels for chopping down egg sacks

[[Seeker]] fixes the command center & laboratory as we find them & downloads all the logs. They weren't researching anything related to the [[Vortirrackt_monster_darkmatter|vortirrackt]] or the void. Boring research. The scientist is also killed by the creatures, tho not as violently as the engineer. kitty alien [[Vortirrackt_monster_darkmatter|vortirrackt]] thingy was meowing in the closet when I found it. Seems nice & friendly, tho [[Ein]] isn't convinced. [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] said I could I keep. It purrs and rubs against me when I ask if it want's to be my friend. It's not in pain or suffering. 
Chance and kitty "Squidworth" lead the way Into the armory, the door closes behind us because of [[Seeker]] & [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]]. there's boring weapons, [[Chance]] gets a phaser & blaster & another set to the bag of holding, there's an attractor mine (to bag of holding) & a (probably)} deconstructive naobot vial (to [[Seeker]]). 

onto the cabin: there another (regular) kitty "Nessie"!! which becomes [[Pyrin]]s new friend. & Cat toys!! [[Chance]] is now pretty distracted. Oh, & there's momentos & pictures & personal stuff we take. [[Ein]] claims the dead plants/pot soil for his pot of soil holding

onto the surgery room.
back at the nest, we got 3 egg sacks, but mine was obviously the bestest

getting back to the shuttle, we met a normal [[Vortirrackt_monster_darkmatter|vortirrackt]]! 
they quickly take it down, dimensional shackle it & vent tape it's mouth. [[Pyrin]] makes us a cube of silence to help. We load the big guy & the eggs. & we hog tie all the limbs. Squidworth nuzzles the VOrtirackt as much as it muzzles me. No queen jumps on our shuttle.
as we depart the derelict, we hear the same screech much louder than before (from the derelict). The QUEEN KNOWS!!!! Warn people not to touch the ship so they don't take my loot. I mean, so they don't die.
[[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] will cast feign death on the big one when we get to the main ship.
[[Seeker]]s goes all diplomat with his [[Scale&Fang]] contacts to get access to a diplomat bay & discreet boxes. [[Chance]] is in a box with [[Squidworth]] the Kittirrackt/Catirrackt to keep it quiet, [[Vortirrackt_monster_darkmatter|vortirrackt]] gets it's own box, & eggs get their own box & we all get trolley'd to the library.

- [ ] [[Chance]] wants to go back to get the loot/ship, hoping that the queen is gonna leave. [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] is convinced the queen is gonna rampage & murderize anybody who comes near the ship. 
We teleport back to [[The_Library]]. The specimens are being taken away.
Gotta take the kitties to medical first to get them cleared, then we can keep 'em. Plus tracker collars. 
[[Keppuc_Un_npc|Keppuc]] & [[Knarl_npc|Knarl]] are there, & both are freakishly calm. "We have a Visitor, [[Mr Morden]]" None of us have heard of him. "He says you've taken something that belongs to his client"  Wait, he got to the library? Before us??? Do the [[Vortirrackt_monster_darkmatter|vortirrackt]] have a lawyer??????? A HUMAN???
