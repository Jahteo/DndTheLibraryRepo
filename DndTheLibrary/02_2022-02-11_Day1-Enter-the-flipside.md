## Session Summary
Cordette is such a podunk town amidst podunk towns, [[Esmerelda_Butterwort_npc]] basically was self-taught psychonaut. [[Torvold]] & [[Cas]] moved injured folks to infirmary & told [[Chance]] to not put krash patches on folks without asking.
[[The_Library#Remotely contact the library thru familiar|Learned how to Remote contact Library thru familiars]]
	Seeker's already a druggy & asked [[The_Library]] for protection rituals in really floofy language & they said figure out the cause & know you're dreaming (lucid dreaming).
[[Torvold]] becomes [[Pyrin]] & [[Seeker]]'s drug dealer while [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] finds boring-ness around the town.
[[Seeker]] & [[Pyrin]] are exxcited to trip, but warn the library first & ask for recovery mat's for ko'd townsfolk waking up upon our success. [[Torvold]] took an extra mushroom after we all take drugs.
### to the sleep realm
everything is mod'ed by int; poor [[Chance]]
Muffly sounds in a traincar, [[Esmerelda_Butterwort_npc]] knitting happily & convinced [[Pyrin]] is "Sapphire". She's very delusional, but being smart & logic-y & confused/worried/freaked out helps wake her up & she poofs.
[[Torvold]] figures out how to bend dream reality & entertains [[Chance]] 
### to the rear, avoid "the conductor"
sickly sweet smells w greasy thugs, i mean lawyers & miners.


## Detailed Log
### Still the first day, been in [[Cordette]] about 4 hours
learned how to [[The_Library#Remotely contact the library thru familiar]]
Cordette is a small "podunk" town, its library has nothing useful about psychedelics. Other nearby towns are also small. [[Esmerelda_Butterwort_npc]]'s journals show she found out stuff from nearby areas, but mostly diy. No hints about finding more info.
Torvold & Cas move more injured folks to infirmary help
- double krash patches from infirmary (not the [[Morph]] one) on a healthyish person makes 'em warm & doesn't wake them up. Won't work to wake us up from any psycho trips
Seeker's inquiry:Please provide available protection rituals against Far Realm incursion during hallucinogenic or psychedelic trips and means of ending such ritual trips. Regards, Seeker.
- answer: figure out whats causing it to stop it. safety precautions: lucid dreaming should be able to pull yourself out of it. Records show people who don't know their dreaming don't know they **can** wake up. Can't wake them up from the outside, period.
Seeker has in the past gone on psycho journeys. Didn't make the magic teas himself, but experienced it.

[[Torvold]] shares magic mushrooms with [[Pyrin]] (to investigate) & [[Seeker]] (to cultivate)
[[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] wanders around town looking for anything unusual. About a mile out, things start getting more normal, bugs/sounds pop back up. [[Seeker]] wants to know if it seems to be spreading or is contained. Bigger animals in some places, no signs of escaping people that passed back out or got injured. Nearest town is 5-6 miles away. asleep/awake animals can be kinda close to each other, so hard to say that it's growing exponentially, if at all.
[[Seeker]] goes to apothecary for notes/potions of lucid dreaming. there are a dozen doses/ droughts of lucid dreaming for sale, very standard seeming.
catch an animal and bring it to town, does it stay awake?
[[Seeker]] & [[Pyrin]] are most excited to start first, [[Gnosis]] is worried about getting left behind. prolly can't summon familiar inside the dream unless they already fall asleep.
report via Cordette sending stone to library: we're gonna sleep excursions to other realm, please send recovery materials for when citizens get better.
we each take a lucid dreaming potion (including familiars) & [[Torvold]] takes an extra mushroom just in case, [[Cas]] stays awake for communication purposes.

### Sleep Realm
speed of thought: Speed is modified by intelligence - 10. Chance's speed goes down by 1.
Strength of mind: str, dex, con saves all rolled as int saves instead. (all of chance's saves are based on int saves instead, lol. This hurts Chance's pride hugely)
[[Pyrin]] summons a bone beast. [[Torvold]] wants to peak into his bag of holding bones, but isn't allowed yet.
We're all together, with our familiars.
It's really quiet. Muffled. Hitting walls sounds like a padded wall. Talking is understandable, but slightly deadened. We're in a train car, sparsely furnished. roast meat & malty beer smell from front train, sickly smell at back, storm outside, old woman in corner knitting from threads being created midair. 
### It's [[Esmerelda_Butterwort_npc]]! 
& she's super happy. [[Pyrin]] goes to chat, & she happily shouts that she's so happy to see "Sapphire"? Pyrin plays along, she's convinced he should be 10, convinces her to drink some of the lucid dreaming potion while he tries on a waaaaay too small sweater. Lucid dreaming potion doesn't seem to work directly. will need to convince her she's dreaming.

[[Torvold]] tries to go outside, train is moving in the storm, but he can get his head out.
[[Seeker]] asks if Esmerelda has seen a conductor recently. "he's probably at the front of the train", she doesn't have a ticket or know where she's going? She is very confused & prompt-able/guidable/gullible in convo. [[Seeker]] tries to break the dream logic for her. She suddenly loses her joy/surprise & is just confused/worried/freaked out. & after a couple minutes she vanishes. [[Cas]] lets [[Torvold]] know she actually woke up & updates [[Esmerelda_Butterwort_npc]] on situation.
Meanwhile [[Torvold]] tries to do lucid dream stuff of changing a wall into side of building instead. It actually starts to change/shimmer, then snaps back. He continues to shift all sorts of odd things. Chance treats it like a laser pointer & tries to catch them all.  

### We go towards the rear, sickly sweet smell where the conductor isn't. 
fancy room with 3 rough cranky folks & 3 fancy folks w clipboards. the car stinks. [[Pyrin]] recognizes 1 fancy gal from a very fancy house, [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] recognizes a rough one she helped patch up, Bucket would have said the rough ones were miners and the fancy's were "lawyers".
(with esmerelda, they were focusing on actual observable dissonance)
(background, the lawyers are the enforcers working for the mine boss to bust up the miners unionizing)
[[Pyrin]] & [[Seeker]] talk to fancy folks, who get more fearful as they get closer. They don't want "laborers" near them. Pyrin fires back verbally. Seeker temp uglies their clothes.
ask torvold & chrysanthos to explain the change-y logic to chance
[[Chance]], [[Torvold]] & [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] go to the miners, who are convinced we work for the mine boss [[Baron Baudrum]], who's really mean. [[Torvold]] asks them specifics & challenges them, they get antsy. they don't recognize that torvald is in armor. cornering/intimidating/confusing them with the reality of our characters kinda snaps 'em aware. [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] & [[Torvold]] get 'em to realize & poof awake.
[[Seeker]] continues working on lawyers (by mage hand slapping them) , who eventually freak out like we've all become horrible monsters (Torvald tries to be extra scary with his shovel). [[Pyrin]] fails to talk with them anymore bc they're so scared. [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] stops one from opening the back door to escape.
seeker casts calm emotions on lawyers.

### (roll initiative & perception checks) 
room is 60' end to end
chrysanthos & pyrin see reflections of us all as horrific demonic creatures in the train window. & somebody at the door behind us.
[[Pyrin]] does a channel divinity ankh thing that gives us 1d4 on attack&saves & resistance to dmg, until takes damage.
[[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] goes to noisy front door to be a distraction when it opens. then it opens! a dude from cordette's bar is here, terrified/armed/attacks [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]]. Torvald blocks the back door & jams it with his shovel form incoming ppl. [[Seeker]] casts the calm emotions he meant to earlier into the next train car Torvald blocked & on the cornered lawyers, they're frighten is suppressed & he tells them they can wake up. (Josh is confused if it worked)
back blocked door vanishes, open to both train cars. They attack torvald & fail.
Chance dragonifies between chrysanthos & bad guy to block things
[[Pyrin]] sends a bone thingy to munch on a guy who doesn't wake up. chrysanthos void light majicks the dude I protected them from. [[Torvold]] fails something & can no longer tell who's an ally. Booming blades a bad guy & the thunder breaks the sound deadening something, it echos, others sounds are no longer muted too. [[Seeker]] casts bane on 2 baddies. (lair action "valience": sleepwalkers have a minor benefit where they look healthier) Chase acid breaths the three in front

as they're taking damage, cas is seriously worried about the drunk about to die in the real world & Torvald will tell everyone as soon as we get back & his confusion/charm ends
