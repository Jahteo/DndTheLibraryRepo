Kyle
Wizard/Necromancer
new to technology/library
rolly-polly looking, you can just see eyes & beard
dwarf in heavy armor, beard billows out from armor plates
wields trench spade
covered in dirt/dust that he sheds as he goes
spellcasting focus is somebody's head. decayed & a bit mummified (from the Crypt.)
	his family are Cryptwardens and guard the crypts. the head was from somebody he had a "contract with" for after they died. It was a great business till the authorities found out he wasn't paying taxes on the income (taxes were the death penalty so he had to flee). The rest of his people probably don't know about the library or the rest of the inter-verse
	rolled a nat1 on a teleportation spell.
