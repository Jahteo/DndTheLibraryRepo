# Scale&Fang
Expensive ~~mercenaries~~ bodyguards hired by [[The_Library]] to do all sorts of missions, but they're really expensive & have "conflicting ideals". They're kinda boring & insist on following rules & don't give [[Chance]] enough candies. Very shiny uniforms.
At least some of them know about [[The_Library]] & have interactions with [[_005-Factions|Library Factions]].

## Important folks:
[[Seeker]] - though he's also really the only one we care about so far.
