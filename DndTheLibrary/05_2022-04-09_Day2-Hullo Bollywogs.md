### Bollywog arrivals
[The Forge](https://forge-vtt.com/game/dmyetti-the-library) for the map!

Teleport to [[Milacul Swamp]], ITS A GIANT PUDDLE!!!!!
slight smell, lots of bugs and gators & 
same material plane as library
[[The_Library]] rumors that the whole asteroid the library is in can be teleported in case of emergency. Has this happened? How awesome of a rollercoaster ride was it?

[[Ein]] is vibrating in excitment about the water & [[Chance]] is about to jump in
[[Dr_ Doolots_npc]] is worried/stressed. been on the planet for a couple years. as a zooologist, enjpying stunign interesting biology & there should not be swamp planets.
Bollywogs/swollybogs are pretty much the same as all others across the galaxy. This is their village. [[Dr_ Doolots_npc]] has set up camp here, but it's def their place.
Town is in lockdown. No one should be wandering around. It's obviously not their got that's evil, but folks keep going missing when they leave. They also don't talk about their god to outsiders.
Mercenaries came with [[Dr_ Doolots_npc]]: [[The fearsome five]]. they're kinda expensive,but cheaper than [[Scale&Fang]]. WE DO NOT TELL ANYONE ELSE ABOUT THE TELEPORTATION SKILLS OF THE LIBRARY, UNDER THREAT OF LIBRARY. RULE ONE OF ~~FIGHT CLUB~~ LIBRARIANS.

[[Dr_ Doolots_npc]] tells us the problem's been going on for 6 weeks, [[The fearsome five]] went out and claim to have found & killed the creature responsible, but things have taken another turn for the worse, so she thinks they lied. The big one they didn't bring back & The dead broodlings they brought back must not have been it. Other researchers claim these are kinda cheap mercenaries, but fight well. They've also nicknamed them The Fearful Five.

[[The fearsome five]] described a creature with tentacles on it's face. Much bigger than the broodlings. They stand by killing the big one, but really don't wanna go back out there. They go on and on about spawn everywhere, constantly more and more made by the big one. No where is safe! So many tentacles! Even the swamp water attacks! It even mind-tricked bollywogs to serve it! Fight location was a couple hours away by boat or too long by walking. They won't go back, but will tell us how to get there. one bollywog even volunteers as a guide to take us close. Darkish, lots of vines, thickets, wet,gross, almost unnaturally so. Knives work great, poison doesn't.

[[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] does most of the investigating. examines the corpse with [[Seeker]]. There's a live one too!!! [[Ser Lawnsalittle]], a gnome male knight shows us in. Creature locked in a cage, covered, fiesty when poked by sticks. High pitched/squeaky/bubbly sounds. [[Chance]] uncovers it & it tries to jedi-mind-trick me into letting it free. Usually they gotta smack a person for getting caught in it's mind skills. 1x/day seems the limit though. 
[[Seeker]] scanning the broodling reminds him of Aboleths/really old things. It's also amphibious. This one was caught "after they killed the big one".

[[Garr Oate]] Female halfling checks in on us. really doesn't like the broodling. Doesn't like this dirty planet. her arm itches really bad. "swamp dries it out" but when she shows us there's actually a little fleshy yellow lump, "the cleric says it's a botfly to leave alone". [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] knows that's definitely not actually a botfly larvae. It showed up a couple days after their big battle. [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] & [[Seeker]] have a private convo about how absolutely bad it could be. & then convince her to let then work with her cleric to remove it. asap.

### Surgery, Surgery

Bollywogs speak a variant of aquan. When [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] & [[Seeker]] show a bollywog shaman an image of the yellow mass on a person, they freak out. It's bad. painful hatching. usually deadly. usually on animals, not people. expect a week or two. The shaman doesn't really wanna interfere bc "it's of their god" & has never happened to any of they're people. But values the person life enough that it's worth helping.

Convince [[Garr Oate]] that [[Pyrin]] can provide her a new arm if needed. Thankfully it's the non-dominant arm

Skill checks for surgery. It's an epic/dramatic surgery actually, much roleplaying/details. [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] was the lead & hands down MVP.
baby parasyte successfully moved to alligator & [[Garr Oate]] is in great condition. 
Insist the [[Cleric]] learn to ask when not sure about something, esp on a strange planet.
Insist to [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] that [[The fearsome five]] deserve compensation for the trauma of almost birthing an aboleth. & that it wasn't all their fault for being out-of-their-depth.

The broodmother & offspring spread through touch, & cause drying out to keep host in water/moist.
