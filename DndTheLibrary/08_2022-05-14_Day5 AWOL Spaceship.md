## Session Summary


## Detailed Log
Maw Stations are the skull of massive creatures that somewhow hold space stations inside them. Ancient space stations. There are humanoid guards called [[Sepulchar Knights]] that come out when needed (judge, jury, executioner)  that we should avoid pissing off. Clad in platinum armor and not-lightsaber swords. they worship [[Old 'Oon']]. & something about a kinda-freakish Sepulchar star is a huge star orbiting the black hole in the center of the universe that the Avia-ra protect. idk
~5k years ago, a race ([[ameboids_race]]) woke up in a maw station (& clocks were already running so it became year 0)

after a good night sleep & getting kitted out
we teleport to a secret room in a library & get ushered out & "checked in" to the station system
[[Torvold]] wants [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] to use speak with dead and talk to the maw station. Ends up buying a tourist tshirt to wear over his armor. 
Introduced to a ship pilot who takes us over to the place (1 jump over) & we arrive at the drifting spaceship, ready to take a shuttle pod over. still at morning. minimal shielding is preventing good scans. Original owners say if we can salvage anything from the original inhabitants they'd like those back (dog tags, personal items, etc. It's been 10 years & they know its [[Vortirrackt_monster_darkmatter|vortirrackt]].) Ship logs would be cool. The design is very modular & they don't know what rooms are where.

 Using [[yetti]]'s board game for the map. 4 escape pods hold 2 ppl each (or 1 dragon)

Land in the shuttle bay, low gravity, thin atmosphere, dead body. [[Chance]] thoroughly enjoys being able to run/bounce off walls. All the doors are open that we can see

Fire, noisy walking, lack of treasure

dark matter crystals are harvested from somewhere fancy and are delicate & need fancy containment. Don't ruin it. Lots of important magicky bits. Except for gnomes, who've managed to do it sans magick. This is a lvl2 dark matter engine. the dwarf home (after they left their planet) is a flotilla that tends to hang out in no-magick zones where other dark matter crystals stop working. But they supposedly have a lvl10 all powerful one. 

This crystal seems to be intact. [[Seeker]]s scan suggests it can probably be turned back on, even without the one broken one. Logs show that something went wrong a few years ago *and it was fixed by someone!* hasn't been used in 10 years tho. from the company's knowledge, the last time the ship jumped, it never reappeared. the logs say it was the last one & was completed fine.  [[Vortirrackt_monster_darkmatter|vortirrackt]] should not be able to understand how to break some of these things (according to Library knowledge)

Comms room - [[Seeker]] tripped the trap & the door closed behind him. Smol alien chest burster tries to eat his face & fails. after catching it, it wiggles out of [[Chance]]s grip but he saves everyone by squishing it. Comm logs show their regular stuff before the jump & then the day it went missing they tried to send a mayday that still has not sent. Something went wrong tho.
