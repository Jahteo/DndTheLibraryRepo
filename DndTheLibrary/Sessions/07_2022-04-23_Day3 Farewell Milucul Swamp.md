## Session Summary


## Detailed Log
### Mosey back 
- [ ] ask yetti if this beastshape is good. It keeps my original hp, no tankiness.
[[Pyrin]] exhumes all the bones for [[Torvold]] to make skeleton archers

Tell Swollybogs that they're god decided to do less, so they may notice changes
NO FIGHTS! We had a talk. To prevent suffering, it decided to reduce it's activity. The mosquitos' were tasty though.
& we'll take/buy/steal the [[The fearsome five]]'s baby thingy.
[[Chance]] investigates a cave, [[Torvold]] helps find the metal things: dinglehopper, goblet, bracelet for me to keep
[[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] makes sure the boat guide is ok with us bringing back a zoo & we get to collect muck from the tree for [[Ein]]
- [ ] ask library to help me talk to trees
nab some critters for the way back
chance realizes how itchy his face is on the way back to town, but there's nothing visible/noticible

### back in town
We tell [[Dr_ Doolots_npc]] about all the critters we saw & what we did. get "storage containers" for the crittters we caught. & tell her what we'll be telling the locals
[[Seeker]] & [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] tell the story of what we did & "deify" the descriptions of the broodling mother. 
shaman [[Grartub]] want to talk to us. [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] & [[Seeker]] & [[Pyrin]].  Shaman doesn't believe they got visions/talked with it, bc the shaman has seen it & can tell that there's something inside the bag of colding that wasn't there before. Cue the tension. & then the shaman let everyone off hte hook & was ok with us slaughtering it. & with the changes that may happen now that it's gone.

[[Torvold]] & [[Chance]] convince [[The fearsome five]] to give us Slimo in exchange of cleaning their hut. So [[Chance]] hunted down [[Seeker]] & dragon'ed him back & proved his cleaning ability by smashing him in the mud. Cue massive cleaning/fixing montage, dragon-back rides for kiddies, & lots of mud splashing. [[Torvold]] takes slimo back with us

### Return to the library
Summon our call home & we get teleported back, start giving things/critters to library
[[Cailynn_Enrie_pedagog_npc|Cailynn]] One of the [[Pedagogs]] reasearchers asks if we'd share an essense. Not now, but we might get one for them later in exchange for something.She can build all sorts of things for us.
Would need a fair essense as materials to make the portable mansion, plus a frail essense as payment.

Debrief with [[Keppuc_Un_npc|Keppuc]] & [[Knarl_npc|Knarl]]: emphasis on the planet will need check-ins, what we told the townsfolk vs teh shaman, random list of our wants. talked with [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] in private about being an intermediary for the shaman [[Grartub]] possibly becoming a librarian.

Chance is getting sleepy and rubbing cheek on walls, [[Seeker]] drops him off at the med bay. we meet [[Captian Wazo Lauthren npc_library]] the halfling that ate the growing candy. His snake familiar  jumped on my face to scan it & it felt really good. [[Captian Wazo Lauthren npc_library|Wazo]] makes a salve & slaps me & says it's neccesary for chance to get food and naps. and leave. & ideally not come back.

- [ ] let yetti know what I wanna do for down time between missions
- weird place with the feisty maul weapon
