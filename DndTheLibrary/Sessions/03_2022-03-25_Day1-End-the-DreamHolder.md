### After combat XXXXXX
ethereal creature rises up in front by [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] & the conductor & another more evil-looking one behind us.
Seeker is frightened from the middle one.
[[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] casts sprit guardians (all the morphs!) & also heals [[Seeker]] who casts bane & rants about there being more.
[[Pyrin]] does a firey thing and send a bone beast to the front, who goes incorporeal & fades into the ground.The middle horror psychic dmg's pyrin & makes him frightened.
[[Ein]] convinces [[Chance]] to try attacking again & surprises [[Torvold]] that it can talk. "it's ok, look, you can bite that one" "but you should bite harder next time". Then Chance hears a whisper in her mind, "Do you really think they like you?" Mope-ly asnwers "nooooo"

[[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] hurts it more.
[[Seeker]] & [[Torvold]] kill the middle one.
[[Chrysanthos(they_them)]]& [[Pyrin]] stand off over hurting the conductor.

[[Pyrin]] walks up and casts animate dead, fails, tries to keep a hand in his bag of bones.Tries more with Torvold
[[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] drags chance away promising that "we can go back" with Seekers help

### Triumphant Return
We all (intenionally) wake up near the infirmary where we passed out. It's been 5 hours.
The bits from the monster didn't return from the dream realm
People start to rouse
find the worst injured people, help, provide consolation, 
Cas summons us all to [[Esmerelda_Butterwort_npc]] where something colorful is crawling out of her ear. A tiny version of the dream holder monster, dying. [[Gnosis]] scans it for the Library & it dissipates to dust. No magic or lingering dust remains. Esmerelda & everybody continues waking up. Everybody survived, except those who died before we arrived.

[[Torvold]] & [[Chance]] take care of the 3-4 dead bodies & burying by the church. mold earth + shovel are faster than a digging dragon.
[[Pyrin]] goes to confront the lawyers & they're in the midst of plan to run away asap. 
[[Cas]] scans the mushroom/drug books for [[Torvold]] & promises a better physical copy.
- [x] Remember the lawyers were hired by the mine boss [[Baron Baudrum]] to bust up the miners unionizing.  
the city is exhausted, but able to finish taking care of themselves & the worst of the people.
familiars let us know the library's ready to teleport su back.
[[Bucket_npc]] & the Cordette Librarian are very greatful. Glad we already ordered more supplies. Teleport home, back to the same massive teleportation circle we left from, & there's also several empty carts around the circle.
[[Keppuc_Un_npc|Keppuc]] & [[Knarl_npc|Knarl]] take us back to debrief. Chance is allowed to go to bed early after a good cuddle/cry with [[Ein]] & [[Jet_npc]]


[[Chance]] needs a good night sleep to feel better, then will pop back to normal, with melancholy memories of being in [[Cordette]]


- [ ] does a slow breath attack also include the slow effect as kyle described it? accepting ac/dex, something else?
(there's a lot of discussion caused by theatre of the mind that could be resolved by a map, even if distances are ignored. We all visualize too differently apparently. often. much explaining and questioning of where tf everyone is.)

### Who scanned what:
[[Gnosis]] scanned aura's & dreemholder
[[Cas]] mushroom & apothacary notes on mushrooms
