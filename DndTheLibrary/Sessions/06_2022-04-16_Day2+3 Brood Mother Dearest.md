## Session Summary


## Detailed Log
- [x] trade backpack of munchies to bollywogs for shinies
- [x] level characted
- [x] pick evolution: evolution blast or beast shapes

- [ ] ask yetti if this beastshape is good. It keeps my original hp, no tankiness.

### Plan the attack! & pass out.
[[Seeker]] thinks we'll need to destroy the baddie, which might also be the god.
We dunno if the baddie the [[The fearsome five]] saw was actually the top boss or just a mid teir boss mob.

[[Dr_ Doolots_npc]]'s been here like 6 months

### Next day, the adventure begins!
[[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] realises the biome is unusually forced, [[Seeker]] suggests it could be the work of the aboleths
& [[Dr_ Doolots_npc]] tells us that there's odd swamp-adapted versions of creatures that you wouldn't normally expect in a swamp. (Ie: they've been here long enough that they've adapted)
Bollywogs don't have any records of anything other than this though.

gifting foods returns gifts of cool art, sculptures, interesting foods
they like new foods! 

take the fan/swamp boat out
lots of mosquitoes to eat. & a fern/tree that dips down to eat the swamp scum.
- [ ] [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] promised to investigate trees on the way back. IT COULD BE A HINT TO GROWING EIN!!!
all sorts of odd things, birds with reptile tails shooting lightning, monkeys with 6 arms, a 8-eyed fish spinning a web around a frog, critters with those yellow growths (esp as we get closer)
[[Chance]] shows ability to beast shape & surprises party.

### Guide draws the line & drops us off.
15 min gross/fun trudge through swampy bits as a dragon
coo clamy air, ground occasionaly sinks under us. very quiet, no more critters or mosquitos

maze/map
baby thingies! got squish
small island, dead creature, lots of yellow infested critters
[[Torvold]] fireballs the minions, boils the swamp & summons mother dearest
[[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] water walks us all
there's i giant cuddle puddle of the thingies!! (swarm)
Acid breath works as expected, shadow-cloaked shove/claymores also work really well.
[[Pyrin]] turns to a biiiig grapley snake & summons an extra boney critter and all the attackeys!
eeeeepic fighting
[[Seeker]] finally helped out by killing it with magic missles.

3 craftable options, but only enough "frail essense" to choose 1
- broodmothers embrace
	- rare magic jacket - water breating, swimming, tentacle lash attack, axn to cause coat to turn into chrysilis and regain hit points
- tomb of living memories - attunable by wizard, spellbook, comes w knowledge from beyond (over min, attempt to get info from brood mothers brain, get major advantages). shrouded spells ( cool spellbook stuff for)
general idea was to harvest & just bank the materials, not actually craft anything yet.
[[Pyrin]] & [[Seeker]] harvested essense & hide
[[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] found flask fot he golden branch. 4 sacks each have colored marbles & clean drinking water. long rest can disolve marbles into clean water in [[_006-LOOT]]
Scans show the [[The fearsome five]] killed the big broodling, but the little ones kiept feeding it & rebuilding it basically. & there's enough little ones & yellow infected ones that it may come back eventually. 
We'll take back broodlings and some infected if possible.

Next session: talk to locals & doolots & get some sleep & maybe even pick the next mission
- [ ] do we need to interact with factions to level with them
- [x] level the character to 7.
- [x] chance realizes how itchy his face is on the way back to town.
- [ ] yetti needs to write some point explanatino thingy about leveling and feats.
