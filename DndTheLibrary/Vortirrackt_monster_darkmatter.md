## About Vortirrackt
[[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] knows about them as a cleric
- very different knowledge than what the library be
[[Seeker]] has dealt with their aftermatter
- knows they're drawn to singularities (black hole thingies)


Darkmatter Monster that's kinda flighty, 10ft tall.
- immunity to radiant dmg (surviving radiation & magic)
- resistant to non-magical dmg (super armored)
from the Void, they don't seem to have a material plane
cross the universe in moments without big magic spells, mostly as a means to escape.
librarian's facing them usually survive.
	but no one's ever survived enough to grab a dead/live one

they can slink through radiation heavy holes (?) that weave around the void
they're attrated to crowds & will often pop in & take someone
unless there's lots of prey, they tend to hunt alone
