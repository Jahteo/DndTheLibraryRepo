### personality based off Ed from Cowboy bebop:
- eccentric, resourceful, giggly, childlike, odd curious, happy-go-lucky teenager. a great susceptibility to distraction, and a tendency to ==talk to herself aloud== and sing nursery rhymes or other literature popular among children. She often ==repeats the last words of the people who spoke before her== and answers questions with seemingly meaningless phrases and sometimes real nonsense.
- She frequently spaces out, similar to a trance, which seems to withdraw her from reality. She almost always ==refers to herself in the third person== and rarely interacts with other characters in a real conversation.
- She could be considered sort of a "free spirit", ==very fond of nature and open spaces.==
- Ed also shares numerous behavioral characteristics of a wild animal. In particular, in regards to her ==tendency to bite people and her way of walking==, in fact, She is ==always barefoot and shifts to four-legged, rolling, or on the palms of her hands==. She even ==uses her feet for tasks== that would normally take place with the upper limbs. On one occasion, She proves to be unable to walk wearing a pair of shoes 
- She likes to ==sleep at least twelve hours== a day, has an incredibly fast metabolism and seems to prefer the company of animals, as seen with her rapport with familiar.
### Quotes
-  "Duty calls, 3 o'clock tea!"
-  "Where are you?! Are you heeerree, Mr. Spooky space creature?!"
-  "Lesson, lesson: If you see a stranger, follow him!"
-  "Dragon/Chance is very busy! Try later!"
-  "Hey, wait a minute, Ein. We have to share and share alike. Ein?"

### Goals
cooler goggle/eyepatch
magic item with lots of  food (cornocopia)
ability to partially dragonize
gold/loot/hoard
turning Ein (the co-familiar) into a dragon whatever he would evolve into (whether or not he actually can...)
