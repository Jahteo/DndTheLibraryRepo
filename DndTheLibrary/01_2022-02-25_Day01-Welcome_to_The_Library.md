# 01_2022-02-25_Day01-Welcome_to_The_Library

## Recap of last session

## 2022-02-25 Session Summary
- [ ] Remind Players: to finish creating familiar stats. check that weapons/armor are picked, skim more "standard issue" gear
- [ ] fill in in missing notes on [[_005-Factions]]

Character & familiar intros. 
Library & [[_005-Factions]] background.
Met our superiors [[Knarl_npc]] & [[Keppuc_Un_npc]]. Knarl pushed for us to take an urgent mission that Keppuc was worried we weren't ready for yet. We chose the sleepy town of [[Cordette]] instead of Swallybog deity mayhem at [[Milacul Swamp]]. 
[[Knarl_npc]] gave us all candy (that morph was cruelly denied) & took us to the Quartermaster for supplies. [[Torvold]] & [[Pyrin]] had lots of necromancer shop-talk/flirting. [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] "promised" to let [[Chance]] see in the suit when they grow up.

Jumbo special circumstance transportation circle was a wild ride.
Met [[Bucket_npc]] the librarian assistant C3PO w mustache/monocle. We learn that 3days ago, people stopped waking up, **strong** "alien" magic (abomination/other dimension). Those who woke ran out of town screaming about conductors & too many pupils (psy dmg) & left a crazy note. Apothecary [[Esmerelda_Butterwort_npc]] was the first case, & was tripping on shrooms unsafely. Cure woulds helped a smidge, remove curse & dispel magic did nothing. Who did she contact? What to do next?

Plans:
- We all go on a psychedelic journey to the center of the universe.
- or sacrifice a familiar. other then [[Ein]]
- maybe have [[Seeker]] ask the library for deets on safe consumption. Maybe via familiar-skynet or datapad-wikipedia?
- hunt down escapee's

## Detailed Log
[[The_Library]] is a secret. Benevolent (but not everyone within it is.)

We meet:
[[Torvold]](Kyle), [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]](Airiel), [[Pyrin]](Daniel) all new to The Library, this is their first mission together
[[Seeker]](Ren)/ & [[Chance]](me!!) have been involved before, but this is still our first library mission


I tell [[Pyrin]] that he's kinda short for a dragon & it's sad he doesn't get bigger
 [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] tells me to please not stare inside until I'm much more aged
 [[Pyrin]] & [[Torvold]] chitchat about raising their familiars & graveyards.
 History of [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]]'s planet was lost after it was destroyed
[[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] explains all about how teleports shouldn't reach [[Torvold]]'s planet

Usually we get to pick missions. However, this time [[Keppuc_Un_npc|Keppuc Un]] & [[Knarl_npc]] are arguing about which missions are suitable for us. Knarl is more ambitious. Keppuc thinks they're bad for our first mission, but gives in bc their both urgent missions (someone else will prolly do the other mission). Knarl explains that Usually the [[The_Library]] is just looking for info, studying. Our team is new experiment with a more capable team to "help" with dangerous operations. [[Scale&Fang]] is who they used to use & it kinda worked, but super expensive & conflicting "ideals". [[Seeker]] was a good merc at least & the library trusts him. Anyways: options:
	- [[Dr_ Doolots_npc]] is a zoo-ologist. She was sent to [[Milacul Swamp]] to study the native Swallybogs. They worship a local deity in a swamp (as swalybogs and bollywogs tend to do), but they're intelligent unlike other bollywogs. Distress call from the Dr, the deity is real & now problematic & becoming a danger. Help. Library's primary purpose is knowledge & preservation of culture, but the people don't deserve to be destroyed, so deal with it as needed. Deets: Mind control-related, minor spawn, sometimes ppl walk away & we don't see them (unless we hold 'em back). We can totes question the swallywogs. (neither of our necromancers can speak with the dead yet, after [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] asked)
		- [[Godseekers]] & [[Marshalls]]
		- supplies have been sent while they're basically under seige
	- One town, [[Cordette]] where there's a library has fallen asleep. Fortunately the librarian assistant is a robot & was able to send a distress signal. Several ppl have died in sleep (esp old/frail) or woken up & run away. Some ppl bleeding from eyes. it wasn't all at once, just as everyone fell asleep naturally
		- [[Dramatists]] & [[Godseekers]]
		- [[Pyrin]] offers that he has a thingy that we can cram in & maybe keep us safe from sleeping
		- Will prolly want some of those Hyper-Krash stim patches
	- while we debate, [[Knarl_npc]] offers us candy!!! (free axn to eat)
		- [[Torvold]] gets "Collossul caramel", [[chance]] gets peice of gummy candy candy "flight o fancy", [[Pyrin]] gets foot-long "resistant rainbow sour", [[Seeker]] gets a pale sugar circle w4 peanuts in a square "tough cookie", [[Morph]] gets a "lightfoot licorice rope"
We mostly decide on sleepy Village
Normally we'd go by ship, but for speed, it's a teleportation circle for faraway.

[[Keppuc_Un_npc]] & [[Knarl_npc]] lead us away
to the [[Quartermaster_npc]] for picking up goodies/equipment
- hyper-krash, 1 can each (5 total) ([[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] loaned me theirs)
- assume we have standard things like torches/ armor/ datapad/suits/first-aide kit
- can get phaser/blaster
- [[Chance]] gets an arc batton does 1d6 lightning damage
Down long twisty corridors we get to a big room with very large circle (5x bigger than normal teleportation circle, w team of casters)
we get in middle & they all begin casting WHEEEEEEEEEE

Into a dingy backroom of library on [[Cordette]]
Robot "[[Bucket_npc]]" greets us! (kinda like C3PO meets roger-roger with a mustache & monacle, plus energentic/worried personality)
Take us to body! Details!
- started 3 days ago. just not waking up. still breathing. "wasting away",
- bodies are malnourished, dying. 
- "[[Kosh_npc]]" male half-elf, steely eyed, crusty eye blood boogers.
- [[seeker]] casts detect magic: definitely powerful magic, specifically on people, not on town, way more powerful than our party possesses. enchantment
- [[Pyrin]] medicine check nat1 "they're asleep". second check: Bleeding eyes is common for psychic damage
- [[Torvold]] casts identify: high level magic, feels "alien", not something that belongs here (something like from FarRealms, different plane, abberation magic)
- Bucket says: no new visitors or magic items, but the apothocary [[Esmerelda_Butterwort_npc]] has been talking about going on trips, but never went anywhere. Actually, she was the first to fall asleep too. 
- People who wake up run away any direction out of town. Very worried. one, [[Ayu_Aeska_npc]], raving about "conductor" that had eyes they didn't recognize "His eyes had too many pupils, I'll never sleep again!" he even left a note.Town has no bugs/birds/animal noises. Everything seems asleep, even elves
	 ![[Pasted image 20220225212537.png | 400]]
- [[Apothecary_shop]] [[Esmerelda_Butterwort_npc]] is in bed, aslo old bloody eyes. 
	- [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] med check: no cuts/ritual wounds. there is a half-drunk glass of tea w strong dirt, savory smell. Not tasty smell. Chrysanthos keeps it out of my reach... [[Seeker]] knows about toxins & plants & herbals, so tries to ID it. It's some type of mushrooms, prolly psychodelic. [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]] & [[Chance]] investigate: apothocary/alchemical notes, on trying to go "farther" & perfect the trips. could have somehow contacted actual beings during the trips
	- [[Torvold]] finds the magic mushroom stash easily & recipe book
Let's wake up her up? Heal her!
Med kit only helps a little. [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]]s cure wounds: +6hp to her, better color, but still KO'd. remove curse: does nothing
[[Torvold]] dispel magic: nothing happens (on a 23)
- [ ] we may need to take trips ourselves, Ren knows we can do so safely.
- [ ] ask the library for how
- [ ] datapad wikipedia???
- [ ] hunt down escapees

- [ ] Set [[Ein]]s Familiar Stats

TBD if [[Chrysanthos(they_them)]]s eats fish flakes from the top...


 Random: 
 - Aviara?? Bird-headed people have a sacred sun. Scans of the sun show there's an unnatural structure inside that magic/tech can't ID. 
 - currency may or may not be fluid across worlds. most things we find we can keep, unless the library needs/claims it. Or we steal, don't steal.
 - week in library = 2 x 4 day "cycle" (so 8 days.)
