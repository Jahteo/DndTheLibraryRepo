- Attractor Mine x1 :  As an action, you can prime this small metallic disk and throw it to a space within 40 feet. Upon landing, the disk crackles with electricity and draws objects within a 5-foot cube toward it. If a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can't move or take reactions until the start of its next turn. After 1 minute, the mine burns out and becomes nonmagical.
