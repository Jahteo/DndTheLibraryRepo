# The_Library
Located in an asteroid somewhere
huge, lots of fake windows with outdoor video scenes
5 wings, one for each faction.
Commissary for buffet meals, often new meals from all the worlds
there is a zoology department with live specimens
[[Quartermaster_npc]] Shop for equipment
[[_003-Familiars|Familiars]] basically have internal maps of the whole library and help us get places

[[_003-Familiars]] abilities tied to library

### Missions
"Superiors (tbd)" facilitates all the missions & coordinates librarian groups. There's two of them.
- [[Keppuc_Un_npc]] tortle
- [[Knarl_npc]] little goblin
interdimensional/inter-planar/inter-everything
	if it exists, they wanna find it & establish a branch

## Currency
May or may not be fluid/exchangeable across worlds. 
Most things we find on missions we can keep, unless the library needs/claims it. Or we steal, don't steal.
